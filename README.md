**<h3>Project 1: Calculator using HTML, CSS, JavaScript</h3>**


Here's a list of the main features and functions in the code:

1. **Calculator Class**: The code defines a `Calculator` class that represents a calculator with various methods and properties.

2. **Clear Function**: The `clear` method clears the calculator's operands, operation, and error message.

3. **Error Handling**: The `showError` method displays an error message, and the `clearError` method clears the error message.

4. **Delete Function**: The `delete` method removes the last character from the current operand.

5. **Append Number Function**: The `appendNumber` method appends a number or a decimal point to the current operand.

6. **Choose Operation Function**: The `chooseOperation` method sets the operation to be performed and computes the result if there's a previous operation.

7. **Compute Function**: The `compute` method performs the computation based on the chosen operation, handling different arithmetic operations and error conditions.

8. **Display Functions**: The `getDisplayNumber` method formats numbers for display with commas and decimal points. The `updateDisplay` method updates the calculator's display with the current and previous operands.

9. **Dark Mode Function**: The `darkMode` method toggles the dark mode of the calculator.

10. **Toggle History Function**: The `toggleHistory` method toggles the visibility of the history section.

11. **Event Listeners**: Event listeners are added to buttons and elements to handle user interactions, such as clicking number and operation buttons, performing calculations, clearing, deleting, toggling dark mode, and toggling the history section.

12. **History Handling**: The code maintains a history of operations and results and updates an HTML list to display the history.

13. **CSS Custom Properties (Variables)**: The code uses CSS custom properties (variables) for defining colors and styles, making it easier to customize the calculator's appearance.

14. **Dark Mode Toggle**: The code includes a toggle for switching between light and dark modes.

15. **Error Message Display**: Error messages are displayed to the user when specific error conditions are met, such as division by zero.

16. **Tooltip**: Tooltips are added to certain icons for additional information.

17. **History Section**: The code includes a history section that displays the user's previous operations and results.

18. **Max History Entries**: The code limits the number of history entries to a specified maximum value.

Overall, this code creates a functional calculator with error handling, dark mode, and a history feature, making it a comprehensive calculator application.
